Project Background: 

1. Creating web applications by implementing and deploying a chat client using Firebase products and services.
2. Building a web app using Angular and Firebase
3. Syncing data using Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage for Firebase
4. Authenticating users using Firebase Authentication
5. Deploying the web app on Firebase App Hosting

Discussion:

  From this lab activity, I have learned how to build a web app using Angular and Firebase, which is called a Friendly Chat app. Through the Friendly Chat app codelab, I discovered some new skills though it might not be some kind of fancy skills. I also learned how to navigate the challenges of creating a functional, real-time chat application as I delve into the world of Flutter and Firebase.

	Initially, setting up the development environment was simple so far, but integrating Flutter with Firebase proved to be a bit daunting. Moreover, most of the Firebase features require me to pay a subscription fee. As a student, I don't really want to withdraw any money from my already nonexistent amount of account balance.
Hence, I ended up using only free tools, which have very limited options. Other than that, I had to skip many codelab that use subscriptions. But obviously, the app still could be built, so I just went with it with every might.

 As I was doing this project, I encountered some new things I had never learned in my previous classes, such as creating repositories and updating commits in GitHub. In fact, this is my very first time using GitHub! There was so much to learn, from understanding how the Firebase works, to debugging complex issues with the help of my classmates and lecturer. 
Most importantly, I developed the patience and problem solving skills needed to overcome obstacles during development.


One of the most satisfying aspects of the codelab was implementing the real-time chat functionality. Watching messages appear instantly on both sender and receiver’s screens was a rewarding experience that validated the efforts I had put in. However, there is a feature that poses some significant challenges, which is adding images. 
It is one of the hurdles I faced during this codelab which was trying to debug the issue of image upload getting stuck on the “loading” animation. After investigating, I realized that this issue was due to incomplete handling of Firebase Storage tasks. This taught me the importance of handling asynchronous functions properly in Flutter and Firebase.


In conclusion, building the Friendly Chat app has opened my eyes to the possibilities of creating impactful, user-centric applications. The Friendly Chat codelab was a challenging yet enriching experience. It gave me hands-on exposure to modern app development tools and frameworks while teaching me to approach problems with persistence and creativity. 
I look forward to applying and continuing my journey as a developer.



# Friendlychat

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
